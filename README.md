## üöÄ Expertise

Much of my journey has been dedicated to the logistics field, where I was able to develop my analytical skills thanks to the significant opportunities I encountered. 
This includes everything from analyses in Excel (where I started), using DAX and Power Query for handling large volumes of data, to building queries in SQL and developing data visualizations, 
transforming data into valuable numbers that have helped and continue to help the operation gain important insights for decision-making. 
In this context, I also contributed to automating some manual tasks (with Python bots \o/), automating simple tasks that used to take analysts hours due to their extremely manual nature.
